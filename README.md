Rochelroutes
============

This is a small project for the dutch NGO 'milieudefensie' http://milieudefensie.nl to raise awareness on 'ultrafijnstof' (ultra fine particles)

For this project a bike equiped with UFS sensors is driven through a city measuring the UFS level, tracking the route with GPS and filming the area. Together with comments on the data this results in 4 files per route:
route.gpx
meetwaarden.csv
video.webm
verhaal.csv

All start at the same moment and as a result a timestamp in any of the files corresponds with the same timestamp in the other files. The browser reads the four files and constructs a multi-faceted view on the route.
